Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. In this project, I used Python and popular data analysis libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn to analyze sales data and gain valuable insights.

The project involved calculating the profit for each sale by subtracting the taxes (at a rate of 14%) from the cash amount. I then explored the overall sales profit and examined how it varied across different weekdays and cities.

By visualizing the data using Seaborn, I was able to create informative and visually appealing charts that helped me understand the patterns and trends in the sales data. These insights can be valuable for decision-making and optimizing sales strategies.

Working on this project allowed me to enhance my data analysis skills and gain practical experience in extracting meaningful information from large datasets. It also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in the business world.

I'm excited to share this project and the valuable insights I gained. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my work or discussing data analysis projects!
